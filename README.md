# full-stack-guestbook-on-gf-breadssignment4

What I wanted to do was create a form data review on gluten free bread. There are so many terrible types out there for so many different reasons, I thought it would be interesting.

I made a table of gluten free bread, you can see the array it made in the sql.sql folder. I feel like that is all I did. I cannot figure out api's, how to use them, how to make them, how to display them, they just consistently evade my grasp. I watched all of last weeks videos on 2x speed with subtitles so that I wouldn't miss anything, I rewatched the cookie cutter video, I know I'm missing something vital that will link them all together, I'm just not sure what???? So because of this I failed. Again.

I know it's going to be something so obvious but I don't know what.

What I also planned on doing (other than completing than actually making the client side), was making it mobile friendly, and also look lovely. But when you have nothing to show it feels like a moot point. Also, the voiceover for accessibility would've been nice, and a like button.
